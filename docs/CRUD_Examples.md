## CRUD Examples

When working with databases you generally want to have [CRUD Functionality][CRUD].

That is, the ability to CREATE, RETRIEVE, UPDATE and DELETE data.

Here are some Javascript examples of how to this using `pg-doc`.

First you need to include the module.

``` js
const pgdoc = require("pg-doc")
const str   = pgdoc.stringify
const parse = pgdoc.parse
```

This gives you access to pgdoc and some handy aliases.
