## Getting Started with pgdoc in NodeJS

If you are going to use pgdoc in an existing project, you need to have a [properly configured PostgreSQL server running][install].

Once you have that all set up, take a look at the [CRUD Examples][crud] that walk you through the basic interactions you can do with the database.

If you want to see more the [examples][example projects] show several different uses of the database in action.

To get a better idea of what pgdoc is doing under the hood, [check out the code][code] and the [SQL scripts][sql].
