## Getting Started with pgdoc in NodeJS

If you find a bug or get stuck somehow, please [mention it in an existing issue][issues] or make a new one if needed.

#### [Install pgdoc][install].

If you are going to use pgdoc in a new or existing project, you need to have a [properly configured PostgreSQL server running][install].

#### [Learning pgdoc][crud]

Once you have that all set up, take a look at the [CRUD Examples][crud] that walk you through the basic interactions you can do with the database.

If you want to see more, the [example projects][examples] show several different uses of the database in action.

To get a better idea of what pgdoc is doing under the hood, [check out the code][code] and the [SQL scripts][sql].
